      <description>&lt;base target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lynch Syndrome is associated with a significantly elevated risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, this risk can be mitigated through early detection and intervention. A pivotal diagnostic method involves identifying lesions in enterocytes using immunohistochemistry on colon tissue samples. A deficient Mismatch Repair (MMR) crypt, termed Adenomatous Crypt Foci (ACF), indicates Lynch Syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Distinguishing healthy and deficient crypts involves assessing their visual characteristics under a microscope, with healthy crypts appearing brown and ACF crypts blue. Other distinguishing criteria are explored in this project. Yet, the rarity of ACF crypts coupled with the manual microscopic examination by specialists - around 15 minutes per slide - hinders efficient diagnosis, with a single patient&amp;rsquo;s results taking around 2.5 hours due to multiple slides.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
