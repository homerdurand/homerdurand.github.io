M. Lewis 2005)\n\n\n## Chaos theory\n\nLyapunov exponent $\\lambda$ measure the sensitivity to initial conditions\n\n$$\n| \\delta Z(t) | = e^{\\lambda t} |\\delta Z_0 |.\n$$\n\nThere could be multiple lyapunov exponent and we usually refer to the largest one, called MLE.\n\n* Periodic behavior of chaotic system must be repelling not attracting\n* Topological mixing: any given regions will eventually overlapp with any other given region\n## Types of uncertainties\n\n## Ensemble forecasting\n\nRetrospective\n\n## From weather to climate\n\n## Counterfactuals\n\n## Predictability\n\n**Palmer 2006:**\n* We should think of weather and climate prediction in terms of equations whose basic prognostic variables are probability densities $\\rho(X, t)$ where $X$ denotes some climatic variables and $t$ denotes time.\n* $\\rho(X, t)dV$ denotes the probability that at time $t$, $X$ true value lies in some volume $dV$.\n* **Fokker–Planck equation:**  partial differential equation that describes the time evolution of the probability density function of the velocity of a particle under the influence of drag forces and random forces, as in Brownian motion \n* **Liouville equation:**  describes the time evolution of the phase space distribution function (fundamental equation of statistical mechanics).\n\n* Fokker-Planck and Liouville equations describe the evolution of the climate system and are practically solved using ensemble techniques.\n* Prior estimate $\\rho_C(X)$ climatological density of $X$.\nWeather or not $X$ is predictable depends wether $\\rho(X, t)$ is sufficiently different from $\\rho_C(X)$, i.e. it is predictable if they are different\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"display: flex; align-items: center;\"\u003e    \n    \u003cimg src=\"../Images/forecast_distributions_palmer_2006.png\" alt=\"Image\" style=\"width: 300px; height: auto; margin-right: 40px;\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\n    If the distributions are very different the weather forecast could be used by decision-makers. The way to compute this divergence is not clear and would depend on the specific decision making. Where one is mainly interested about extreme events then measuring the distance between the probabilities after a critical point might be prefered to an overall distance measure. This might for example be the case in figure 1.1.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n* $\\dot{X} = F(X)$ might be nonlinear and the Jacobian $dF/dX$ depends linearly (at least) on the state $X$\n$$\n\\frac{d \\delta X}{dt} = \\frac{dF}{dX}\\delta X.\n$$\n\nThe tangent propagator \n$$\nM(t, t_0) = \\text{exp}\\int_{t_0}^t  \\frac{dF}{dX}\\delta t'\n$$\ndepends on the nonlinear trajectory $X(t)$ about which the linearisation is performed. Hence the evolved perturbation becomes\n$$\n\\delta X(t) = M(t, t_0)\\delta X(t_0).\n$$\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"display: flex; align-items: center;\"\u003e    \n    \u003cimg src=\"../Images/Lorenz69_Palmer_2006.png\" alt=\"Image\" style=\"width: 300px; height: auto; margin-right: 40px;\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\n    Assume that all points on the left of the attractor are frosty and the ones on the right side are frost-free. On the basis of the top left forecast all next weather are gonna be frosty. On the basis of the bottom forecast it is impossible to say if it is gonna be frosty or not.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nThe solution to Liouville equation which formally describes the evolution of $\\rho(X, t)$ arising from initial errors only can be written using the tangent operator, ie\n$$\n\\rho(X, t) = \\rho(X', t)/det(M(t, t_0))\n$$\n\nwhere $X'$ corresponds to the initial state which evolves into state $X$ at tie $t$.\n\n**Types of uncertainties:**\n* Uncertainty in observations used to define initial state\n  * \n* Uncertainty in the model used to assimilate the observations and make the forecasts\n* Uncertainty in 'external' parameters:\n  * Content of aerosols, change in CO2 emissions\n  * Should we add random volcanoes into simulations? How would this modify the distribution estimation?\n  * \n\n#### Initial uncertainty\n\nData assimilation:\n$$\nJ(X) = \\frac{1}{2}(X - X_b)^\\top B^{-1}(X - X_b) + \\frac{1}{2}(HX - Y)^\\top O^{-1}(HX - Y)\n$$\n\nwhere $X_b$ is the background state, $B$ and $O$ are covariance matrices for the pdf of background error and observation error, $H$ is the **observation operator** and $Y$ the vector of available observations. (see [Courtier et al., 1998](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/qj.49712455002)). The hessian \n$$\n\\nabla^2_X J = B^{-1} + H^\\top O^{-1}H\n$$\ndefines the inverse analysis error covariance matrix.\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"display: flex; align-items: center;\"\u003e    \n    \u003cimg src=\"../Images/Isopleth_Palmer_2006.png\" alt=\"Image\" style=\"width: 300px; height: auto; margin-right: 40px;\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\n    We can see how an isopleth of the covariance matrix of errors evolves under the action of the tangent propagator $M$. The vector pointing along the major axis at forecast time corresponds to the leading eigenvector of the forecast error covariance matrix. Its preimage at initial time corresponds to the leading eigenvector of MtM.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nGiven pdfs of uncertainty based on def of $J(X)$ we can in principle perform Monte Carlo sampling of the Hessian-based initial pdf and produce ensemble forecast system based on initial sampling. There is three good reasons not to do that:\n* **Curse of dimensionality:** The sate space of a weather prediction model is too big (order $10^7$) making the process too computationally intensive. See [Lorenz 1965](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2153-3490.1965.tb01424.x) and its 28 variables model.\n* **Other uncertainties:** In practice, initial conditions uncertainties are not the only uncertainties. But the remaining uncertainties might not be well defined as part of *unknown unknowns*. Some process are well captured by simulations at the given grid size (laminar flow) but some others not at all (turbulent flow).\n* **Overconservativness:** might be prefered for very risky events. Thus one would need to sample perturbations that are likely to have significant impacts on the forecast.\n\nFor these reasons, together with the fact that the 20 to 30 first eigenvalues of $M^\\top M$ are of greater scales than the remaining ones, the initial perturbations of the ECMWF ensemble prediction system are based on the leading eigen vectors of $M^\\top M$. \n\n#### Model uncertainty\n\n* There is no underlying theory which allows us to estimate the statistical uncertainty when integratingequations of climate on a computer. \n* **Parametetrisation:** is the process of approximating the effects of unreolved processes on the resolved scales. \n* **Hierarchical uncertainties:**\n  * Multimodel ensemble (DEMETER)\n  * multiparametrisation ensemble (Meteorological Service of Canada)\n  * multiparameter ensemble (perturbation of $\\alpha$) (climateprediction.net ensemble system)\n\nThis hierarchical representation is rather pragmatic than theoretically grounded approach (and not complete).\n\n**Souldn't we use the MAP instead of the mean state???**\n\nLet's note $\\rho_m(X)$  be the representation of unresolved scales where $X$  is some resolved-scale variable. Let consider an ensemble prediction system where the grid-box mean variable is $X_0$ across all members of the ensemble. Assuming that instead of using he deterministic subgrid parameterisation $P(X_0, \\alpha)$ across all members we force the ensemble prediction system by randomly sampling $\\rho_m(X_0)$. Then the ensemble-mean would evolve differently because of nonlinearity. **Making it as a question.** Why?\n\n* We move from an arbitrary ensemble of multimodels where parametrisations difference does not represent anything meaningful to one where each ensemble member is equipped with a possible realisation of subgrid process.\n* **Reasons why it should be better (stochastic dynamic vs multimodel):**\n  * More accurate representation of model uncertainties\n  * Reduction of model systematic errors\n  * More accurate internal variability representation (important for **climate change detection**)\n\n  We can write the equations of motion of the climate/weather prediction model as\n$$\n\\dot{X} = F(X) + P + e\n$$\n\nwhere $e = \\epsilon P$ and $P$ denotes the conventional parametrisation term and $\\epsilon$ \n\n#### Types of forecast\n\n**Extended range** (monthly time scales): Used originally to find which period were predictable (more than $P_W$). In early times, the methods fro initial condition perturbations were simple:  adding random noise on initial conditions or using time lagged techniques. In 2004: singular vector ensemble initial conditions perturbations (see [Vitart 2004](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/132/12/mwr2826.1.xml)).\n\n**Medium range forecast:** Using both singular values initial perturbation and stochatsic physics.\n* [Lothar cyclone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Lothar) in december 1999 was exceptionally unpredictable and even 42 hours lead time there is a considerable spread in the ensemble. The best guidance deterministic forecast only predicts a weak trough in surface pressure. \n* However a couple of members show a strong vortex over France. The ensemble was able to predict something that a deterministic forecast could not. \n\n**Seasonal and decadal predictions:** Interaction between atmosphere and slower components such as oceans and land surface.\n* Predictability of ENSO are predictable seasons ahead of time using intermediate-complexity coupled ocean-atmosphere of the tropical Pacific.\n* Using inital conditions perturbation of both atospheric and ocean state.\n* Use of multimodel ensembles (DEMETER)\n\n\n**Climate change:**\n\n**Short range forecasting:** For a long time, weather forcasting was seen as a deterministic task up to 2 days. Nowadays, falshfloods and other similar events \n* Ensemble boundary conditions\n* initial perturbations\n\n**Underdispersivity and unknown unknowns**\n\n#### Uncertain forecast from deterministic dynamics\n\n* Lorenz system:\n\t* Each dote is a weather of possible climate (attractor)\n\t* Weather can be seen as a realisation of the irreducible uncertainty of the chaotic climate system\n\t* Predictability of Lorenz (like climate) is very state dependent\n\t* Phase space\n\t* If proba of initial conditions represents correctly uncertainty and model correct then we get correct estimate of forecast uncertainty\n\t* Stochastic dynamic predictions (Epstein 1969)\n\t* Liouville équation\n\n$$ \n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} +  \\nabla (\\dot{X} \\phi) = 0\n$$\n\nIs familiar to continuity (ie conservation) équation for mass. Here $\\phi$ is the uncertainty distrib and $\\dot{X}$ the total derivatives wrt time of the prognostic variables defining the coordinate axes of the state space.\n\t* The total proba of any system is by def 1\n\t* The governing physical dynamics are contained on $\\dot{X}$, known as tendencies. Integration of this equation is deterministic (there are no Radom terms introduced on the right hand sides of the dynamical tendencies)\n\t* Stochastic diffusion forcings and jump processes are integrated threw Chapman-Kolmogorov equation\n\t* But direct intergation too computationally expensive\n\n\n* **personal questions:**\n  * What makes that sometimes errors of dynamical system grow exponentially and sometime not? \n  * Also how can some part of the system (eg mean state) do not have an error growing exponentially? How can we get a linear response? To some perturbations and a non linear one to others?  --\u003e","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"https://hugo-profile.netlify.app/courses/intro_ensemble_forecasting/","title":"03 - An introduction to ensemble forecasting"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eThis course notes are in preparation and should be released around mid-May.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"https://hugo-profile.netlify.app/courses/intro_validation_probabilistic_forecasting/","title":"04 - An introduction to the validation of probabilistic forecasting"},{"content":"\u003cbase target=\"_blank\"\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this data challenge, I tackled semantic segmentation using a dataset of satellite images.

This idea was reinforced\n  by research during the 1940s, which developed the theory that\n  changes in the orbit of the Earth around the sun controlled the\n  waxing and waning of the great ice ages. A second line of argument\n  was that because there is 50 times more carbon dioxide in the\n  oceans than in the atmosphere, it was conjectured that ‘The sea\n  acts as a vast equalizer’, in other words the ocean would mop up\n  our pollution.\n\n  ## Modern Science\n\n  * 1940s experiment shown that carbon dioxide did block the\n  transmission of infrared ‘long-wave’ radiation.  experiments showed there was very little\n  change in this interception if the amount of carbon dioxide was\n  doubled or halved\n  * This work was brought together\n  in 1955 by the calculations of Gilbert Plass, who concluded that\n  adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere would intercept\n  more infrared radiation, preventing it being lost to space and thus\n  warming the planet.\n\n\n  * argument that the oceans would soak up the extra\n  anthropogenically produced carbon dioxide.\n  * 1950s and showed that the average lifetime of a carbon\n  dioxide molecule in the atmosphere before it dissolved in the sea\n  was about ten years.\n  *  Roger Revelle: Did it stay there or diffuse back into the atmosphere? How much\n  extra CO2 could the oceans hold? Revelle’s calculations showed that\n  the complexities of the surface ocean chemistry are such that it\n  returns much of the carbon dioxide that it absorbs.the exact amount of anthropogenic carbon\n  dioxide taken up per year by the oceans is still in debate. It is\n  thought to be about 2 gigatonnes, nearly a third of the annual total\n  anthropogenic production.\n  * Charles Keeling: late 1950s and early 1960s Keeling used the most modern technology available to measure the concentration of atmospheric CO2 in Antarctica and Mauna Loa.

This report unveils the outcomes of this exploration, along with the novel research directions that emerged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe central inquiry of this project revolves around the applicability of the History Matching technique, also known as Iterative Refocussing, in fine-tuning coupled ocean-atmosphere models. Using a simplified model, the Lorenz-96, which can be seen as an approximation of an Atmosphere Ocean General Circulation Model, I demonstrated the potency of the History Matching method in effectively constraining the model\u0026rsquo;s parameter search space. Notably, this breakthrough was validated across scenarios resembling AMIP (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project) and OMIP (Ocean Model Intercomparison Project) experiments. In AMIP-style setups, a pared-down atmosphere model reacts to ocean observations, while in OMIP-style experiments, a simplified ocean model responds to atmospheric observations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe report also introduces valuable insights derived from the History Matching method. It proposes a strategy to streamline the process by employing linear (Empirical Orthogonal Functions) or non-linear (Autoencoders) dimensionality reduction techniques, leading to a significant reduction in the number of metrics employed. Furthermore, the project sheds light on the potential replacement of Gaussian Process Regressors in History Matching with promising alternatives: Random Forest and Bayesian Neural Networks. Though these propositions demand further validation, they hold exciting prospects for enhancing model emulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmidst these advancements, the report underscores the paramount importance of accessible tools for accurately and straightforwardly gauging prediction uncertainties across various models. The research journey embarked upon during this internship not only contributes to refining coupled ocean-atmosphere models but also opens doors to novel techniques and insights that can reverberate across diverse scientific domains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/project_reports/Rapport_Stage.pdf\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRead full report\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/projects/HM.png","permalink":"https://hugo-profile.netlify.app/projects/history_matching/","title":"History Matching for climate model tuning - experiments on the Lorenz96 toy model"}]
