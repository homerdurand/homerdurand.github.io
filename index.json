The way to compute this divergence is not clear and would depend on the specific decision making. Where one is mainly interested about extreme events then measuring the distance between the probabilities after a critical point might be prefered to an overall distance measure. This might for example be the case in figure 1.1.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n* $\\dot{X} = F(X)$ might be nonlinear and the Jacobian $dF/dX$ depends linearly (at least) on the state $X$\n$$\n\\frac{d \\delta X}{dt} = \\frac{dF}{dX}\\delta X.\n$$\n\nThe tangent propagator \n$$\nM(t, t_0) = \\text{exp}\\int_{t_0}^t  \\frac{dF}{dX}\\delta t'\n$$\ndepends on the nonlinear trajectory $X(t)$ about which the linearisation is performed. Hence the evolved perturbation becomes\n$$\n\\delta X(t) = M(t, t_0)\\delta X(t_0).\n$$\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"display: flex; align-items: center;\"\u003e    \n    \u003cimg src=\"../Images/Lorenz69_Palmer_2006.png\" alt=\"Image\" style=\"width: 300px; height: auto; margin-right: 40px;\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\n    Assume that all points on the left of the attractor are frosty and the ones on the right side are frost-free. On the basis of the top left forecast all next weather are gonna be frosty. On the basis of the bottom forecast it is impossible to say if it is gonna be frosty or not.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nThe solution to Liouville equation which formally describes the evolution of $\\rho(X, t)$ arising from initial errors only can be written using the tangent operator, ie\n$$\n\\rho(X, t) = \\rho(X', t)/det(M(t, t_0))\n$$\n\nwhere $X'$ corresponds to the initial state which evolves into state $X$ at tie $t$.\n\n**Types of uncertainties:**\n* Uncertainty in observations used to define initial state\n  * \n* Uncertainty in the model used to assimilate the observations and make the forecasts\n* Uncertainty in 'external' parameters:\n  * Content of aerosols, change in CO2 emissions\n  * Should we add random volcanoes into simulations? How would this modify the distribution estimation?\n  * \n\n#### Initial uncertainty\n\nData assimilation:\n$$\nJ(X) = \\frac{1}{2}(X - X_b)^\\top B^{-1}(X - X_b) + \\frac{1}{2}(HX - Y)^\\top O^{-1}(HX - Y)\n$$\n\nwhere $X_b$ is the background state, $B$ and $O$ are covariance matrices for the pdf of background error and observation error, $H$ is the **observation operator** and $Y$ the vector of available observations. (see [Courtier et al., 1998](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/qj.49712455002)). The hessian \n$$\n\\nabla^2_X J = B^{-1} + H^\\top O^{-1}H\n$$\ndefines the inverse analysis error covariance matrix.\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"display: flex; align-items: center;\"\u003e    \n    \u003cimg src=\"../Images/Isopleth_Palmer_2006.png\" alt=\"Image\" style=\"width: 300px; height: auto; margin-right: 40px;\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\n    We can see how an isopleth of the covariance matrix of errors evolves under the action of the tangent propagator $M$. The vector pointing along the major axis at forecast time corresponds to the leading eigenvector of the forecast error covariance matrix. Its preimage at initial time corresponds to the leading eigenvector of MtM.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nGiven pdfs of uncertainty based on def of $J(X)$ we can in principle perform Monte Carlo sampling of the Hessian-based initial pdf and produce ensemble forecast system based on initial sampling. There is three good reasons not to do that:\n* **Curse of dimensionality:** The sate space of a weather prediction model is too big (order $10^7$) making the process too computationally intensive. See [Lorenz 1965](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2153-3490.1965.tb01424.x) and its 28 variables model.\n* **Other uncertainties:** In practice, initial conditions uncertainties are not the only uncertainties. But the remaining uncertainties might not be well defined as part of *unknown unknowns*. Some process are well captured by simulations at the given grid size (laminar flow) but some others not at all (turbulent flow).\n* **Overconservativness:** might be prefered for very risky events. Thus one would need to sample perturbations that are likely to have significant impacts on the forecast.\n\nFor these reasons, together with the fact that the 20 to 30 first eigenvalues of $M^\\top M$ are of greater scales than the remaining ones, the initial perturbations of the ECMWF ensemble prediction system are based on the leading eigen vectors of $M^\\top M$. \n\n#### Model uncertainty\n\n* There is no underlying theory which allows us to estimate the statistical uncertainty when integratingequations of climate on a computer. \n* **Parametetrisation:** is the process of approximating the effects of unreolved processes on the resolved scales. \n* **Hierarchical uncertainties:**\n  * Multimodel ensemble (DEMETER)\n  * multiparametrisation ensemble (Meteorological Service of Canada)\n  * multiparameter ensemble (perturbation of $\\alpha$) (climateprediction.net ensemble system)\n\nThis hierarchical representation is rather pragmatic than theoretically grounded approach (and not complete).\n\n**Souldn't we use the MAP instead of the mean state???**\n\nLet's note $\\rho_m(X)$  be the representation of unresolved scales where $X$  is some resolved-scale variable. Let consider an ensemble prediction system where the grid-box mean variable is $X_0$ across all members of the ensemble. Assuming that instead of using he deterministic subgrid parameterisation $P(X_0, \\alpha)$ across all members we force the ensemble prediction system by randomly sampling $\\rho_m(X_0)$. Then the ensemble-mean would evolve differently because of nonlinearity. **Making it as a question.** Why?\n\n* We move from an arbitrary ensemble of multimodels where parametrisations difference does not represent anything meaningful to one where each ensemble member is equipped with a possible realisation of subgrid process.\n* **Reasons why it should be better (stochastic dynamic vs multimodel):**\n  * More accurate representation of model uncertainties\n  * Reduction of model systematic errors\n  * More accurate internal variability representation (important for **climate change detection**)\n\n  We can write the equations of motion of the climate/weather prediction model as\n$$\n\\dot{X} = F(X) + P + e\n$$\n\nwhere $e = \\epsilon P$ and $P$ denotes the conventional parametrisation term and $\\epsilon$ \n\n#### Types of forecast\n\n**Extended range** (monthly time scales): Used originally to find which period were predictable (more than $P_W$). In early times, the methods fro initial condition perturbations were simple:  adding random noise on initial conditions or using time lagged techniques. In 2004: singular vector ensemble initial conditions perturbations (see [Vitart 2004](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/132/12/mwr2826.1.xml)).\n\n**Medium range forecast:** Using both singular values initial perturbation and stochatsic physics.\n* [Lothar cyclone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Lothar) in december 1999 was exceptionally unpredictable and even 42 hours lead time there is a considerable spread in the ensemble. The best guidance deterministic forecast only predicts a weak trough in surface pressure. \n* However a couple of members show a strong vortex over France. The ensemble was able to predict something that a deterministic forecast could not. \n\n**Seasonal and decadal predictions:** Interaction between atmosphere and slower components such as oceans and land surface.\n* Predictability of ENSO are predictable seasons ahead of time using intermediate-complexity coupled ocean-atmosphere of the tropical Pacific.\n* Using inital conditions perturbation of both atospheric and ocean state.\n* Use of multimodel ensembles (DEMETER)\n\n\n**Climate change:**\n\n**Short range forecasting:** For a long time, weather forcasting was seen as a deterministic task up to 2 days. Nowadays, falshfloods and other similar events \n* Ensemble boundary conditions\n* initial perturbations\n\n**Underdispersivity and unknown unknowns**\n\n#### Uncertain forecast from deterministic dynamics\n\n* Lorenz system:\n\t* Each dote is a weather of possible climate (attractor)\n\t* Weather can be seen as a realisation of the irreducible uncertainty of the chaotic climate system\n\t* Predictability of Lorenz (like climate) is very state dependent\n\t* Phase space\n\t* If proba of initial conditions represents correctly uncertainty and model correct then we get correct estimate of forecast uncertainty\n\t* Stochastic dynamic predictions (Epstein 1969)\n\t* Liouville équation\n\n$$ \n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} +  \\nabla (\\dot{X} \\phi) = 0\n$$\n\nIs familiar to continuity (ie conservation) équation for mass. Here $\\phi$ is the uncertainty distrib and $\\dot{X}$ the total derivatives wrt time of the prognostic variables defining the coordinate axes of the state space.\n\t* The total proba of any system is by def 1\n\t* The governing physical dynamics are contained on $\\dot{X}$, known as tendencies. Integration of this equation is deterministic (there are no Radom terms introduced on the right hand sides of the dynamical tendencies)\n\t* Stochastic diffusion forcings and jump processes are integrated threw Chapman-Kolmogorov equation\n\t* But direct intergation too computationally expensive\n\n\n* **personal questions:**\n  * What makes that sometimes errors of dynamical system grow exponentially and sometime not? \n  * Also how can some part of the system (eg mean state) do not have an error growing exponentially? How can we get a linear response? To some perturbations and a non linear one to others?  --\u003e","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"https://hugo-profile.netlify.app/courses/intro_ensemble_forecasting/","title":"03 - An introduction to ensemble forecasting"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eThis course notes are in preparation and should be released around mid-May.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"https://hugo-profile.netlify.app/courses/intro_validation_probabilistic_forecasting/","title":"04 - An introduction to the validation of probabilistic forecasting"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eWe here summarise the work of \u003ca href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8439889\"\u003eMeinshausen (2018)\u003c/a\u003e.

In this context, a more robust learning framework is the minimization of the worst-case risk, where the distribution $Q$ of $(X, Y)$ is chosen from a set of possible distributions $\\mathbb{Q}$. This can be formally written as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e$$\n\\arg\\min_{\\theta} \\sup_{Q \\in \\mathbb{Q}} \\mathbb{E}[\\ell(Y, f_{\\theta}(X))]\n$$\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe class $\\mathbb{Q}$, often referred to as the \u003cem\u003euncertainty set\u003c/em\u003e, can be constrained using distributional metrics such as $f$-divergence (see \u003ca href=\"https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2016/file/4588e674d3f0faf985047d4c3f13ed0d-Paper.pdf\"\u003eNamkoong (2016)\u003c/a\u003e) or the Wasserstein distance (see \u003ca href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-017-1172-1\"\u003eEsfahani (2015)\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this work, we consider a set of distributions $\\mathbb{Q}$ arising from interventions on covariates. We will see that allowing different sets of interventions leads to different types of robustness and generalization guarantees. The next section introduces key concepts from causality to help define intervention-based distributions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-causal-inference-paradigm\"\u003eThe Causal Inference Paradigm\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"modularity-assumption\"\u003eModularity Assumption\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s begin with a simple example. Suppose we are given two variables, temperature $T$ and altitude $A$, along with their joint distribution $p(T, A)$. Statistically, this distribution can be factored in two ways:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e$$\np(A, T) = p(A \\mid T)p(T)\n$$\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eor\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e$$\np(A, T) = p(T \\mid A)p(A)\n$$\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second factorization is considered \u003cem\u003ecausal\u003c/em\u003e because $p(T \\mid A)$ reflects a physical mechanism linking altitude to temperature, up to some noise. This mechanism is said to be \u003cem\u003emodular\u003c/em\u003e, meaning that if we intervene by changing altitude, the mechanism remains stable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast, the first factorization is \u003cem\u003enon-causal\u003c/em\u003e, as $p(A \\mid T)$ does not represent a stable mechanism. There\u0026rsquo;s no reliable way to model how altitude would respond to changes in temperature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a joint distribution is entailed by a directed acyclic graph (DAG), the graph is called \u003cem\u003ecausal\u003c/em\u003e if it respects modularity. That is, manipulating one variable does not alter the conditional distributions of the others. This becomes more intuitive under a \u003cstrong\u003eStructural Causal Model\u003c/strong\u003e (SCM), where each variable is defined by a function of its parents. Formally, an SCM $\\mathcal{C}$ consists of structural assignments:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e$$\nX_i := f_i(PA_i, N_i), \\quad i = 1, \\dots, n\n$$\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhere $PA_i$ are the parents of $X_i$, $N_i$ is a noise term, and $f_i$ is a stable (modular) function. The modularity assumption implies that interventions change only the relevant functions, leaving others untouched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"interventions\"\u003eInterventions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, we’ve used the idea of \u003cem\u003emanipulation\u003c/em\u003e informally. In causal inference, we formalize it using the concept of \u003cem\u003eintervention\u003c/em\u003e. Given a set of variables $X$ governed by an SCM, a (strong) intervention sets a variable to a fixed value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning to the altitude and temperature example, assume their relationship is captured by the SCM:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e$$\nT = f(A, N)\n$$\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhere $f$ is a deterministic, modular function and $N$ is some noise.

We assume that a part of the covariates are known to be exogenous. We call these \u003cem\u003eanchor variables\u003c/em\u003e, denoted $A$. Anchor variables aim to generalise the framework of instrumental variables (IV) regression, which assumes the presence of an exogenous variable that affects $Y$ only through $X$ (exclusion restriction). The anchor framework relaxes this exclusion restriction by only assuming exogeneity of $A$.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore concretely, the distribution of $(A, X, Y)$ is entailed by the following SCM:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} X \\ Y \\ H \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{B} \\begin{pmatrix} X \\ Y \\ H \\end{pmatrix} + \\varepsilon + \\mathbf{M} A,\n$$\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhere $H$ represents hidden confounders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssuming the graph is acyclic, the matrix $(I - \\mathbf{B})$ is invertible, and the SCM can be written as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} X \\ Y \\ H \\end{pmatrix} = (I - \\mathbf{B})^{-1}(\\varepsilon + \\mathbf{M} A).\n$$\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this framework, we allow interventions only on the anchor variables $A$.

The training distribution is denoted by $P$.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the presence of hidden confounders $H$, the causal parameters are non-identifiable. Thus, learning a causal model that remains stable under all possible interventions is impossible (see previous chapter).

However, this risk can be mitigated through early detection and intervention. A pivotal diagnostic method involves identifying lesions in enterocytes using immunohistochemistry on colon tissue samples. A deficient Mismatch Repair (MMR) crypt, termed Adenomatous Crypt Foci (ACF), indicates Lynch Syndrome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistinguishing healthy and deficient crypts involves assessing their visual characteristics under a microscope, with healthy crypts appearing brown and ACF crypts blue. Other distinguishing criteria are explored in this project. Yet, the rarity of ACF crypts coupled with the manual microscopic examination by specialists - around 15 minutes per slide - hinders efficient diagnosis, with a single patient\u0026rsquo;s results taking around 2.5 hours due to multiple slides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project\u0026rsquo;s primary objective is to harness deep learning and machine learning techniques to aid specialists in detecting enterocytes and distinguishing different crypt types. This initiative aims to expedite diagnosis, facilitating swifter patient intervention during the onset of disease symptoms.
